Description: Alternative mechanism for importing objects from packages
    and R modules. The syntax allows for importing multiple objects with a single
    command in an expressive way. The import package bridges some of the gap
    between using library (or require) and direct (single-object) imports.
    Furthermore the imported objects are not placed in the current environment.
