# POxload

POxload is a web tool to evaluate the amount of drug solubilized by amphiphilic, triblock copolymeric poly(oxazoline)/poly(oxazine) (pOx/pOzi) micelles.
It is based on predictions for loading efficiency (LE) and loading capacity (LC) using four different thresholds for each parameter (LC 10/20/30/40%, LE 20/40/60/80%).
The formulations are assumed to be made via thin-film hydration using ethanol as solvent and an elevated temperature of 55 °C during re-hydration.

Details can be found in our [publication](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.4c00086).

## Web application

The program can be used via the streamlit web app ```poxload_streamlit.py```, accessible at:
